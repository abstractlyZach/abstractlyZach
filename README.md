## Oh hi 👋
Didn't see you there. Come in come in! 

Help yourself to some snacks 🍰; feel free to pet my dog 🐕. His name is Zach Jr.

Now that you're all settled in, would you like a tour of my profile? 

Yeah? OK, let's go! 😄

## My current project(s) ⭐
### reZIDE 
a comfy custom IDE where you can feel right at home :house_with_garden:

## My setup 🖥️
I love customizing my computer setup. I'm always learning about new tools and [browsing the internet for inspiration](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

Here are some screenshots of my current setup:
