## Oh hi 👋
Didn't see you there. Come in come in! Help yourself to some snacks 🍰; feel free to pet my dog 🐕. His name is Zach Jr.

Now that you're all settled in, would you like a tour of my profile? Let's go! 😄

## my current project ⭐
[reZIDE][rezide] 

## my setup 🖥️
I love customizing my computer setup. I'm always learning about new tools and [browsing the internet for inspiration](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn).

Here are some screenshots of my current setup:

If you'd like to see some of the things that make my setup look cool:

* [my utility scripts][utils]
* [creating automatic IDE-like environments][rezide]
